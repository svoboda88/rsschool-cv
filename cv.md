### About me
My name is Yauheni, i am 25 y.o.. Since i passed 2-years mandatory work after studying in university i decided to change my activity. My purpose is to become front-end developer because nowadays IT scope actively progressing and being in demand. I have an 2-years experience of working in a team as a brigade chief on a gas factory. My main ability was to find a way out of any problem or difficult situation i faced.
